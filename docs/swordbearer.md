# Swordbearer Guide

[**This guide is originally written by Boof (@.boofy. on discord)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lpGxdbCOqSEJD_Rn2Oz2LIoYJBMqRXCHfnRC90a4GfY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.q4dkb4hryw8w), this guide is focused around the core mechanics needed to clear a Rifts/Trails. I am not a min/maxer any build/stat recommendations are going to be more general to help as many people as possible. Though this guide is aimed at tanks, as Rift/Trail mechanics will be discussed in detail this may pose helpful for other classes besides swordbearer.

## [SwordBearer] How to read this guide?

Every trail will start off with the required (req) and recommended (rec) active skills for each trail, whether you have to manual or if you can auto a skill, followed by basic comments as for why and when the skill needs to be used. After which the mechanics of the trail are discussed in detail with gifs/pictures as well as what skills you need to worry about for that specific mechanic.

### R5/T5 Phase 1

All the attacks you need to look out for in phase 1 also appear in phase 2.

#### Minions

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/6svxBTs/Screenshot-2024-12-16-160606.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-12-16-160606" border="0"></a>

Boss spawns 2 tree stumps that attack the players. If not killed within 12s they self-destruct causing massive DMG to the party. They can heal themselves making them harder to kill.

- Don’t target minions, the boss will follow you and it moves where the minions spawn.

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/8YSjL6X/Screenshot-2024-12-16-160404.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-12-16-160404" border="0"></a> Use if dps can’t take out the minions in time and healer can’t heal enough. Doing it before **Last Words** when minions are around can be helpful.

#### Infection/Last Words - DOT/Curse

##### Infection

When the boss charges up but his arms are not over his head it will apply one of two status effects.

Infects some players (this is indicted by a poison cloud around them) and take massive DMG every 0.5s for 10s

- This can be cleansed by healer.

##### Last Words

All players are cursed for 6s. Each tactical skill cast applies 1 stack of the curse up to 3 stacks. Curse deals DMG every 0.5s for 6s

- Healers CAN’T cleanse this.
- Core skill will not apply any stacks of the curse.
- Avoid using tactical skills to avoid applying stacks.

#### Evil Wood Heavy Strike

Circle will appear around the targeted player and will deal massive DMG.

- Tank should use shield.
- During phase 2 there is no circle. Use taunt as the boss shifts target after DMG is dealt.

### R5/T5 Phase 2

Phase 2 starts after the first health bar goes to 0. All the attacks in phase 1 appear in phase 2. Only new attacks or changes to attacks from phase 1 will be discussed below.

#### Violent Ground Smash

Right after he phases he will usually use this attack, however this sometimes gets skipped. The boss will charge up an attack, indicated by the bar filling up, dealing massive amounts of DMG to all targets every 0.5s for 7s. The end of the barrage of attacks is indicated by the bar depleting. This attack can happen more than once if the battle gets prolonged.

Tanks can use this skill to help out the healer during ground smash.

#### Leaf Rain/Raging Ent King

Leaf Rain: Boss restoring 1% of lost HP to itself and minions every 1s while dealing a large amount of DMG to players.
Raging Ent King: a buff applied to the boss if Leaf Rain is not interrupted. Boss increases in size and greatly increasing ATK and attack speed.

- Though this can be interrupted, the buff on the boss does not last that long and in most cases it can be tanked through.
- For Trail version you might need someone to interrupt.

#### Evil Wood Heavy Strike

Same as in phase 1 but there is no more circle and boss shift targets after DMG is dealt.

Use taunt to regain aggro. The boss shifts target after DMG is dealt.
